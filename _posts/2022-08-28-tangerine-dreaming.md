We did one random question in everyday standup meeting. Last week there was a question “What’d you do if you are on a talent show?”. 

When it was my turn, I joked that my talent would be packing. There’s always something that pops up at the very last minute, and I manage to cram it into my already full luggage. 

My colleagues laughed.

A week later, my yearly talent show begins - attempting to fit clothes for all seasons into a carry-on bag. I reflect on the fun of traveling, which includes the art of packing. My first long journey was a 9-hour flight to Finland. I was unsure of what could be brought onto the flight and what needed to be checked in. I felt anxious even asking for a cup of juice.

Many years have passed since then, and I've developed my own packing techniques. I can now do solo trips, check bags, engage in random conversations with interesting strangers, and journey to new destinations while listening to my favourite spiritual music through noise-canceling headphones. I've matured.

Yet, I still hold onto some childhood habits. I always prefer sitting by the window with the shade open, hoping to spot something surprising or interesting. Even if there's nothing to see, I find solace in the various shapes created by trees and clouds.

This year marks the longest summer I’ve ever experienced - almost 4 months. For the past 12 years, I've spent every summer with the orchestra, rehearsing, gaming, and performing with some of the best people I've ever met. This year, however, is different.

A year ago, I arrived in Pittsburgh, starting a new chapter in my life in the US. The summer here is much hotter than I anticipated, although not as scorching as Shanghai. Yet, the city lights, accompanied by the array of brake lights, occasionally evoke memories of Shanghai, creating a peculiar feeling of nostalgia despite the vast differences.

The long summer days make time feel surreal, often leading to erratic sleeping patterns. Sometimes, I find myself gazing out the window or standing still on the street, captivated by the breathtaking sunset at 9 pm. Another day passes, and my productive nightlife begins.

There's one item on my bucket list that I'm determined to achieve this year — freediving. I want to swim alongside various fish, observing them revel in their freedom. It sounds incredibly beautiful. However, deep down, I know I'm not the best swimmer, and I have a certain fear of the water. Nonetheless, I believe it's important to forge a bond with the ocean, much like the mindset I adopted when I first learned to surf—embracing the falls as part of the journey - “He just want to hug me!“ Then falling becomes interesting.

I will figure it out. Excited about the next talent show!
