I was 4 yrs old when I started on the violin on 14th July 2002 (thanks to my mother of having a notebook to write down the progress and problems after each lesson), and took the first viola lesson in July 2009. There are endless reminiscences flashing through my mind now and omg I just can’t imagine it’s been 20 years. I’ve got two admirable violin teachers and one viola teacher. Two of them are in their 70s but they act not only as a skillful and professional teacher, but we also surprisingly became good friends after class. They taught me how to respect and show the power of women.

An useful takeaway during this 20 years is, when you are feeling stuff, and you are got to hold on to that. 

My greatest musical hero, though, was my mom, who sacrificed so much to my musical education. She’s always been the biggest believer in me, and I wouldn’t be where I am today without her.

## Thankful for every part of this journey. 20 and fabulous!
