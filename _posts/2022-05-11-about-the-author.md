Hi there! I'm Yiyun Hu(she/her). I’m a Economics major turned programmer. Trying to explore an elegant and comfortable solution to tackle the real-world problem and make it have its own value (when you are reading these sentences, you are somehow holding my codes), the whole process is extremely cool to me.

In spare time, I am a big fan of classical music. Music is definitely a big part of my life and I have played the viola in the symphony orchestra since 11. To this day, I believe music and its collaborative nature opened up certain channels in my brain, allowing me to understand concepts, both inside and outside of the classroom. It makes me who I am, and continues to shape who I will be. I’d be glad to interact with new people exchanging ideas and experiences. Feel free to send me a message (You can find it in Contact Bar:)
