Hi, my name is Yiyun Hu. I am currently a graduate student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Prior to CMU, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), and spent 1 year studied in Kuala Lumpur at [University of Malaya](https://www.um.edu.my/).

Now I'm working as a software engineer intern in a tech company. I enjoy the process of problem-solving, from dissecting the problem, creating something meaningful, and contributing good to society based on my knowledge and techniques, where I can harvest the sense of accomplishment during and after. Trying to explore an elegant and comfortable solution to tackle the real-world problem and make it have its own value, the whole process is extremely cool to me.

I was born and raised in Shanghai. I was 4 yrs old when I started on the violin, and became a viola player in [Shanghai City Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_City_Symphony_Orchestra) and [Shanghai Youth Philharmonic Orchestra](https://misa.shsymphony.com/artist/detail/68/en) since 10. Besides, I enjoy outdoor activities, hiking, traveling, boxing, CrossFit and can't live without cold brew :)
