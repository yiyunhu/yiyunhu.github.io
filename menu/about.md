I am currently a graduate student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I received my Bachelor's degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), and spent 1 year studied in Kuala Lumpur at [University of Malaya](https://www.um.edu.my/).

I was born and raised in Shanghai. I was 4 yrs old when I started on the violin, and became a viola player in [Shanghai City Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_City_Symphony_Orchestra) and [Shanghai Youth Philharmonic Orchestra](https://misa.shsymphony.com/artist/detail/68/en) since 10.
