I’m an Economics major turned programmer. Trying to explore an elegant and comfortable solution to tackle the real-world problem and make it have its own value, the whole process is extremely cool to me. I am currently a graduate student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Prior to CMU, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), and spent 1 year studied in Kuala Lumpur at [University of Malaya](https://www.um.edu.my/).


I was born and raised in Shanghai. I was 4 years old when I started on the violin, and became a viola player in [Shanghai City Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_City_Symphony_Orchestra) and [Shanghai Youth Philharmonic Orchestra](https://misa.shsymphony.com/artist/detail/68/en) since 10. To this day, I believe music and its collaborative nature opened up certain channels in my brain, allowing me to understand concepts, both inside and outside of the classroom. It makes me who I am, and continues to shape who I will be. 


My favorite violinist is Hilary Hahn, and favorite composers are Tchaikovsky, Mahler and Bruchner. I just can’t pick only one.


Nature and broccoli always make me happy. I also enjoy CrossFit and can’t live without cold brew :-)
